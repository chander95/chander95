👋 Hi, I’m Juan Alexander Salmeron but you can call me Alex. 
👀 I currently work in the financial services space as a shareholder specialist for the Bank of New York and as a financial advisor with Primerica. I interested in learning to code because I would like to make a career change and I have some ideas for development projects I'd like to turn into reality, even if only for personal use.
🌱 I’m currently learning Software Engineering via Coding Temple. The current curriculum includes:
- Python
- Relational Databases
- HTML/CSS
- API Development
- JavaScript
- React
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that serve a purpose in advancing humanity towards a more ecofriendly and socially conscious future.
